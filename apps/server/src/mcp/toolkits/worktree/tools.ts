To keep working after the handoff, pass continuationPrompt with the remaining work: it is queued as the thread's next message and starts a new turn inside the worktree with the conversation preserved. Without it the thread stays idle until the next message. The worktree is not removed automatically when the thread is deleted. Fails if the thread is already attached to a worktree.",
