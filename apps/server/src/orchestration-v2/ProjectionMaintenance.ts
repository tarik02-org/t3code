    /**
     * Full event-store compaction. Projections are the working state (startup
     * verifies rather than replays), so events only serve afterSequence
     * catch-up and disaster-recovery rebuild — and for full-payload "state of
     * the entity" events, anything but the newest per entity is dead weight
     * in both. Three passes:
     *
     * 1. Superseded thread-state events (visits alone accumulate at multiple
     *    per minute while a thread is open).
     * 2. Superseded message.updated / node.updated events per entity id —
     *    streaming rewrites the same message many times. turn-item.updated is
     *    deliberately NOT compacted: rebuild derives turn_item_positions from
     *    those events with first-write-wins semantics, so keep-latest would
     *    change replay outcomes for reordered items.
     * 3. Legacy v1 thread events and their pre-migration command receipts for
     *    threads whose v2 import completed — the v1 store is only read to
     *    import from, and imports never re-run once transcript_imported_at is
     *    set.
     *
     * VACUUM is deliberately not run here: on the synchronous driver it would
     * block every query for minutes on a multi-GB file. The reclaimable page
     * count is reported so the caller can surface a hint instead; freed pages
     * are reused, so the file stops growing either way.
